      MarkD is an advanced live markdown editor directly in your browser. It is built using
      SvelteKit and supports HTML as well as Markdown, all in the same file. MarkD is an open source
      project and a very opinionated one at that. All of the styles are inline tailwind css classes,
      and the Markdown linter is built on svelte-markdown.
